### Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer with 15+ years experience in the Media and Entertainment Industry. I am primarily a python developer, but I've also worked with a lot of front end technologies including Angular, Vue, and HTMX. 
This is my personal github page with projects I work on in my spare time. 

- 👨‍💻 I'm currently working on Asset Veranda - my C++ MAM or TimecodeTools my Go CLI Tool
- 🔭 Make sure to check out LineDream - my generative art library for Python
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love skiing, mountain biking, and rafting!

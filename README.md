### Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer with 15+ years experience in the Media and Entertainment Industry. I work with in both front end and backend - but prefer the latter. Technologies I work with are Python, Go, Angular, and HTMX. 
This is my personal github page with projects I work on in my spare time.

- 👨‍💻 I'm currently working on Asset Veranda - my C++ MAM or TimecodeTools my Go CLI Tool
- 🔭 Make sure to check out LineDream - my generative art library for Python
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love skiing, mountain biking, and rafting!
